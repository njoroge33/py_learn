# Complete the class TimeSpan
# A TimeSpan object stores a span of time in hours and minutes (for example, the time span between 8:00am and 10:30am is 2 hours, 30 minutes)
# Each TimeSpan object should have the following methods:
#       - get_hours()
#       Returns the number of hours in this time span
# # - get_minutes()
#       Returns the number of minutes in this time span, between 0 and 59
# # - add(hours, minutes)
#       Adds the given amount of time to the span
# # For example, (2 hours, 15 min) + (1 hour, 45 min) = (4 hours)
# # Assume that the parameters are valid: the hours are non-negative, and the minutes are between 0 and 59
# # - add(timespan)
#       Adds the given amount of time (stored as a time span) to the current time span
# # - get_total_hours()
# Returns the total time in this time span as the real number of hours, such as 9
# 75 for (9 hours, 45 min), rounded to two decimal places
# The minutes should always be reported as being in the range of 0 to 59
# That means that you may have to "carry" 60 minutes into a full hour
