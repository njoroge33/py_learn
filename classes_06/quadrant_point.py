# Create a class called Point that includes two instance variables - x(type int) and y(type int) 
# Provide a constructor that initializes the two instance variables 
# Provide decideQuadrant() method in the Point class 
# The method should return which quadrant of x/y this Point object falls in 
# Quadrant 1 contains all points whose x and y values are both positive 
# Quadrant 2 contains all points with negative x but positive y 
# Quadrant 3 contains all points with negative x and y values 
# Quadrant 4 contains all points with positive x but negative y 
# If the point lies directly on x and/or y axis return 0 
# Create a Point object and display object's quadrant
