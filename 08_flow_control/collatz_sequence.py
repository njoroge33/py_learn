# Take any natural number n 
# If n is even, divide it by 2 to get n / 2 
# If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1 to get 3n + 1 
# Repeat the process indefinitely 
# In 1937, Lothar Collatz proposed that no matter what number you begin with, the sequence eventually reaches 1 
# This is widely believed to be true, but has never been formally proved 
# Write a program that inputs a number from the user, and then displays the Collatz Sequence starting from that number 
# Stop when you reach 1 
# Count the number of steps
